Tokenization services
=====================

Kripta Key Tokenization Service (KK-TS) provides the following services, in addition to all services provided
by KK-Cryptoservice.

.. glossary::

    Vault-based tokenization
        Applications requiring tokenization services that finds the vaultless tokenization service inadequate
        should opt to use KK-TS's vault-based tokenization. This tokenization has desirable properties in exchange
        for space, which is used by the vault.

    Vault-based detokenization
        This service detokenizes vault-based tokenized input. It retrieves the underlying sensitive value
        by looking up its vault.

    Sensitive value masking
        Masking redacts parts of sensitive values, replacing each masked character with the masking character.
        As a result, no unmasking service is offered, as data is discarded in the process of masking.
