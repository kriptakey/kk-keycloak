Kripta Key licensing
====================

Introduction
------------

Kripta Key licensing is a formal commitment from Klavis Kripta to customers who use Kripta Key
as part of their solutions. There are several types of license available for Kripta Key,
each catering to a different customer need.

A Kripta Key license is valid for a certain amount of time, and may be renewed at the end of its validity period.
A single license is valid for a single Kripta Key deployment, which includes the main KK-Manager instance,
several KK-Cryptoservice instances, a KK-Auditor instance, and several KK-Manager-DR instances.


License model
-------------

Kripta Key comes with an evaluation license upon deployment. This evaluation license is valid for 30 days.
To continue using Kripta Key, a valid license must be applied. For this version of Kripta Key, the license
comes in two different models: **Subscription** and **Perpetual**.

*   **Subscription**: On this license model, the customer must specify the duration of license (1, 3, or 5 years),
    the number of KK-Cryptoservice instances, and the number of KK-Manager-DR instances while applying
    for the license. The **subscription** license has two editions:

    *   **Standard**: all REST API endpoints are available except E2EE endpoints.
    *   **Enterprise**: all REST API endpoints are available.

*   **Perpetual**: On this license model, the license is valid in perpetuity. Customers need only to pay
    the cost of technical support annually --- this is called the Annual Technical Support (ATS) cost.
    This license is only available for appliance packages, and only **Enterprise** edition is available.


Add-on features
---------------

While applying for a license, the customer may also opt in for additional features, subject to requirements.
Currently, on this version of Kripta Key, Klavis Kripta offers three add-on feature: SNAP BI, Vaultless Format Preserving Encryption (FPE), Functional Module (FM).


SNAP BI
~~~~~~~

SNAP BI (Standar Nasional Open API Pembayaran) is a payment policy released by Bank Indonesia
for the payment industry. This add-on feature is only granted to banks that comply to this standard.
This feature enables certain services that is required to conform to the policies set forth by Bank Indonesia.

Vaultless Format Preserving Encryption (FPE)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vaultless Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) is a cryptographic technique that encrypts data while preserving its original format.
It is a vaultless tokenization method, meaning the token and metadata are stored by the user. It implements the FPE algorithm, specifically FF1. 
However, the FF1 algorithm is considered broken. We implement FF1 instead of AES for this API because of its format-preserving properties. 
Therefore, this add-on feature only for specific use cases.

Functional Module (FM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Functional Module (FM) is a component that contains APIs designed to execute scripts that establish custom relationships between APIs
within the KK-CS system. Users can customize how these APIs interact, allowing for efficient execution of multiple KK-CS functions in a single operation.
This service helps users create scripts that call multiple KK-CS functions at once, reducing execution time and improving efficiency.
