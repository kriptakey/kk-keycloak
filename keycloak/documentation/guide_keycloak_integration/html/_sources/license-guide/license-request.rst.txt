Requesting a license
====================

Customers who wish to continue using Kripta Key after the evaluation license has expired must apply
for a full license. To do so, follow the steps below:

#.  An administrator must generate a license request file by running the command:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ clikk kk-manager request-license --out-license-request=/path/to/license-request.file

    This command is **normal** privilege level, which requires an administrator's password.

#.  The customer then sends the license request file to the sales team (sales@klaviskripta.com),
    along with other required information:

    *   Customer name
    *   Deployment ID
    *   Product edition (Standard or Enterprise)
    *   License duration (1, 3, or 5 years)
    *   Number of KK-Cryptoservice instances
    *   Number of KK-Manager-DR instances
    *   Optionally, list of desired add-on features
