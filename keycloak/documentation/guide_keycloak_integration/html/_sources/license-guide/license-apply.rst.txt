Applying your license
=====================

After receiving the license file from the sales team, an administrator may apply the license
by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ clikk kk-manager apply-license --license-file="license.file"

This command is **critical** privilege level, which requires two administrators to authenticate
with their passwords and smartcards.


Applying a license from evaluation license
------------------------------------------

When a license is applied to a deployment on an evaluation license, several system changes occur. Thus,
it is important that the administrators follow the steps below to propagate the changes to all instances
involved in the deployment.

#.  Restart the KK-Auditor service on the KK-Auditor instance, so that the applied license takes effect.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo systemctl restart kk-ad.service

#.  Restart the KK-Manager service on the KK-Manager instance, so that the applied license takes effect.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo systemctl restart kk-md.service

#.  For each KK-Cryptoservice instance, do the following:

    #.  Stop the KK-Cryptoservice service.

        .. code-block:: console

            $ sudo systemctl stop kk-csd.service

    #.  Re-register the KK-Cryptoservice instance. Refer to :doc:`/sys-admin-guide/index` for details
        on the ``clikk kk-cryptoservice add`` command.

        .. todo::

            TODO: Link this reference once Sysadmin Guide is rewritten.

    #.  Restart the KK-Cryptoservice service.

        .. code-block:: console

            $ sudo systemctl start kk-csd.service

#.  For each registered application, re-register the application. Refer to :doc:`/sys-admin-guide/index`
    for details on the ``clikk app add`` command.



Renewing existing license
-------------------------

Before renewing the license on a deployment, to ensure that the new license information properly propagates
to all instances, perform the following steps:

#.  Ensure all KK-Cryptoservice instances and KK-Manager-DR instances are connected to the KK-Manager instance.

#.  Apply the new license.

#.  Double-check that the replication to all KK-Cryptoservice and KK-Manager-DR instances was successful.

#.  Restart the KK-Cryptoservice service on each KK-Cryptoservice instance.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo systemctl restart kk-csd.service

#.  Restart the KK-Manager service on each KK-Manager-DR instance.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo systemctl restart kk-md.service
