Before deploying Kripta Key
===========================

Smooth operation of Kripta Key assumes the following:

#.  Users are trustworthy and competent.
#.  Kripta Key is deployed in a physically secure environment.
#.  The following components are set up and ready to use:

    *   SGX-enabled Intel® processors. Additionally, the motherboard and the BIOS must support SGX as well.
    *   A load balancer with TLS passthrough capability.
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.2 operating system.
    *   Kripta Key SDK, allowing applications to securely connect to the KK-Cryptoservice instances using :term:`mTLS`.
    *   :term:`NTP` enabled on all servers that run Kripta Key modules.

#.  Java cards and dedicated card readers, supplied by Klavis Kripta.
#.  :term:`CLIKK` connected to the KK-Manager instance using one-way TLS. If CLIKK has not been installed,
    refer to the :doc:`/clikk-installation-guide/index` for installation.


Preparatory steps
-----------------

Before installing Kripta Key, the following steps must be done:

#.  Prepare servers for KK-Manager, KK-Cryptoservice, and KK-Auditor. These servers require the following:

    *   Not less than 4 GB of RAM installed.
    *   SGX-enabled processor --- see: `Intel processors supporting the Intel® SGX with Intel® SPS`__ or Intel® ME.

    *   Motherboard that supports SGX.
    *   BIOS that supports SGX, and SGX enabled via BIOS. The following steps show how enabling SGX via BIOS
        might look like (steps may differ with different BIOSes and different systems --- refer to the vendor's
        guide document):

        *   Restart the machine.
        *   Enter the BIOS by pressing F9.
        *   Choose Advanced |rarr| Intel® Software Guard Extensions.

        *   Set Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX) |rarr| Intel® SGX Control to Enabled.

        *   Press F12 to save the settings and reboot.

    *   Ensure the operating system is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2.

    Additionally, SGX2 support can be checked by following the steps shown in :ref:`appendix:checking for SGX2 support`.
    The following steps show how to enable SGX2 on xFusion:

    *   Connect to xFusion iBMC web interface. The default iBMC IP address is `192.168.2.100`.
    *   Login with administrator credential and select Virtual Terminal.
    *   If the server is not running, then power on the server. Otherwise, reboot the server.
    *   Press Del on your keyboard in Virtual Terminal to enter the BIOS.
    *   Choose **Setup Utility**.

    *   Do a factory reset before enabling SGX. Go to **Advanced** |rarr| **Processor Configuration**.

    *   Set ADDDC Sparing to Disabled. Go to **Advanced** |rarr| **Socket Configuration** |rarr| **Memory Configuration** |rarr|
        **Memory RAS Configuration**, and then set ADDDC Sparing to Disabled.

    *   Set UMA-Based Clustering to Disabled (AII2AII). Go back to the **Advanced** menu, and then choose
        **Common RefCode Configuration**. Set UMA-Based Clustering to Disabled (AII2AII).

    *   Set Total Memory Encryption (TME) to Enabled. Go back to the Advanced menu, and then choose
        **Socket Configuration** |rarr| **Processor Configuration**. Set Total Memory Encryption to Enabled.

    *   Next, set SW Guard Extensions (SGX) to Enabled.

    *   Press F10 to save the settings and reboot.
    *   Afterwards, enter the BIOS configuration and set PRMRR Size to 4GB.

#.  Prepare the KK-Manager, KK-Cryptoservice, and KK-Auditor RPMs.

.. note::

    It is up to the original equipment manufacturer to publish the specs for their products. Please confirm
    SGX support with the motherboard vendor before purchasing a particular motherboard model.

.. important::

    During installation, the KK-Manager, KK-Cryptoservice, and KK-Auditor binaries require ``sudo`` to run correctly.
