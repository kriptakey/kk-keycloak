Installing KK-Cryptoservice on cloud
====================================

.. important::

    Before running the installer, perform :ref:`an integrity check <appendix:performing integrity checks>` first.
    Also, make sure that the installer is appropriate for the machine's OS.

.. note::

    If errors were encountered during installation, details will be logged to ``/var/log/kriptakey``.

.. note::

    Please contact support@klaviskripta.com if any problems were encountered during installation.


Accessing the ECS instance
--------------------------

First, the administrator must access the ECS instance and upload the KK-Cryptoservice installer via SSH.
Have the SSH key file ready (``kk-keypair.pem``), and get the instance's public IP address
from the ECS Instance page. This example assumes that the instance's public IP address is ``149.129.213.7`` ---
replace this value with your instance's public IP address.

#.  Set the key file's permission, or SSH will refuse to use the key file.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo chmod 400 kk-keypair.pem

#.  Upload the KK-Cryptoservice installer and its dependencies.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ scp -i kk-keypair.pem kk-cs-2.0-0000.el8.x86_64.rpm sgx_rpm_local_repo.tgz root@149.129.213.7:/root/

#.  Log in to the ECS instance with the key file.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ssh -i kk-keypair.pem root@149.129.213.7


Enabling SELinux
----------------

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux systems that allows administrators
to have more control over who can access the system. SELinux defines access controls for the applications,
processes, and files on a system. It uses security policies, which are a set of rules that tell SELinux
what can or can’t be accessed, to enforce the access allowed by a policy.

Kripta Key leverages SELinux to add another layer of security to the files stored on the system.

#.  Run command below on the ECS instance to modify the config file of SELinux.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo vi /etc/selinux/config

#.  Find the line ``SELINUX=disabled``, press the ``i`` key to enter edit mode, and then modify this line
    to ``SELINUX=enforcing``. The configuration file should be similar to this:

    .. code-block:: ini

        # This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
        # SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
        #     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
        #     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
        #     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
        SELINUX=enforcing
        # SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
        #     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
        #     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
        #     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
        SELINUXTYPE=targeted

#.  Create a file named ``.autorelabel`` file in the root directory, and ensure the file is successfully created.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ touch /.autorelabel
        $ ll /.autorelabel

        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jul 24 15:18 /.autorelabel

#.  Restart the ECS instance. After the instance is restarted, SELinux will automatically relabel all system files.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo shutdown -r now

#.  Run ``getenforce`` and ``sestatus`` to check if the SELinux is enabled and the current mode is ``enforcing``.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ getenforce
        $ sestatus

        SELinux status:                 enabled
        SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
        SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
        Loaded policy name:             targeted
        Current mode:                   enforcing
        Mode from config file:          enforcing
        Policy MLS status:              enabled
        Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
        Memory protection checking:     actual (secure)
        Max kernel policy version:      33


Setting up VPN between Kripta Key instances
-------------------------------------------

In order to set up VPN on the ECS instance, the SSL client certificate obtained in the configuration step
(``certs.zip``) must be uploaded to the ECS instance. Follow these steps to upload the certificate and set up VPN
on the ECS instance.

#.  Upload the VPN SSL client certificate archive to the ECS instance.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ scp -i kk-keypair.pem certs.zip root@149.129.213.7:/root/

#.  Upgrade the ``epel-release`` package.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

#.  Install the ``epel-release`` package.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo dnf install epel-release

#.  Install the OpenVPN client and the unzip package.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo dnf install openvpn
        $ sudo dnf install unzip

#.  Extract the certificate archive, and then run the OpenVPN client daemon using the configuration.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo unzip certs.zip
        $ sudo openvpn --config config.ovpn --daemon

#.  Run ``ifconfig`` to check if the VPN tunnel has been created successfully.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ifconfig

        tun0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.0.6  netmask 255.255.255.255  destination 192.168.0.5
        inet6 fe80::1c70:bb56:9e37:16a8  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 100  (UNSPEC)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 12  bytes 734 (734.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

    The IP address after ``inet`` is the KK-Cryptoservice instance's host. Use this IP address
    when registering the KK-Cryptoservice instance.

#.  Repeat steps 3 to 6 on the KK-Manager instance's machine. Ensure that the VPN tunnel
    has been created successfully.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ifconfig

        tun0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.0.10  netmask 255.255.255.255  destination 192.168.0.9
        inet6 fe80::1c70:bb56:9e37:16a8  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 100  (UNSPEC)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 12  bytes 734 (734.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

    The IP address after ``inet`` is the KK-Manager instance's host. Use this IP address as the KK-Manager
    host address in the KK-Cryptoservice configuration file.


Setting up KK-Cryptoservice dependencies
----------------------------------------

Before proceeding with KK-Cryptoservice's installation, its dependencies must be installed first. Hence,
this step may be skipped if the dependencies have already been installed.

The administrator must download `Intel SGX Platform Software`__ and upload the ``sgx_rpm_local_repo.tgz`` archive
to the ECS instance. Then, follow these steps:

__ https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.23/distro/rhel9.2-server/sgx_rpm_local_repo.tgz

#.  Extract the packages.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ tar -xvf sgx_rpm_local_repo.tgz

#.  Navigate to the ``sgx_rpm_local_repo`` directory, and enable the repository.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ cd sgx_rpm_local_repo
        $ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo $(pwd)

        Updating Subscription Management repositories.
        Adding repo from: file:///home/user/sgx_rpm_local_repo


Installing KK-Cryptoservice
---------------------------

Once everything is all set, the administrator may begin installation of KK-Cryptoservice on the ECS instance.

#.  Install KK-Cryptoservice from the RPM package. Note that KK-Cryptoservice depends on the packages
    in ``sgx_rpm_local_repo``. However, these packages are not signed with GPG. Hence, it must be installed
    without performing the GPG check.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo dnf --nogpgcheck install kk-cs-2.0-0000.el8.x86_64.rpm

    .. note::

        *   The installer automatically creates the user ``kripta``.
        *   The user ``kripta`` can only read files from the working directory.
        *   The administrator, using their usual user account, **cannot** write directly to the working directory.
            Files must be moved as the user ``kripta`` to the working directory.
        *   During the installation process, the location of the working directory must be specified.
            It is highly recommended to use the default value.

    .. todo::

        TODO: What happens if there's no configuration file?

#.  After successfully installing KK-Cryptoservice, it must be configured by running its configuration script.
    This will configure settings such as port, log level, SNMP server, and so on. Do note the following
    when running the configuration script:

    *   Make sure to use the host IP address obtained while setting up the VPN.
    *   The port may be any port from 1024 to 49151, inclusive.
    *   Configuring the SNMP server is optional --- errors are still recorded to the log file. However, it is
        strongly recommended to configure the SNMP server so that critical alerts from Kripta Key can be
        noticed promptly. To configure the SNMP server, the administrator must prepare the SNMP host and port,
        SNMP username, SNMP authentication passphrase, and SNMP privacy passphrase.
    *   For some configuration fields, the script will set a default value if value is omitted when prompted.
    *   The working directory must be writable by the ``kripta`` user. For this reason, it is recommended
        to use the default value, ``/var/local/kriptakey/kk-cryptoservice``.

    Execute this command to set or change the KK-Cryptoservice instance's configuration.

Registering the KK-Cryptoservice instance
-----------------------------------------

Once the KK-Cryptoservice instance is set up, the administrator may proceed with registering it
to the KK-Manager instance.

#.  Get the machine platform information. The output file will stored in the ``sgxdata`` directory.
    On the ECS instance, run the following:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo -u kripta kk-csd --get-pck-id

        Platform information has been written successfully to /var/local/kriptakey/kk-cryptoservice/sgxdata/8F0FFCDCXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.json.

    Copy the platform information to the machine that has CLIKK installed on it. The machine platform information
    will be used to request the platform collateral from Intel.

#.  Request the platform collateral from Intel. On the machine with CLIKK on it, run the following:

    .. code-block:: console

    To get the Intel API key, check :ref:`appendix:obtaining intel api key` in the appendix.

    Copy the PCK certificate and collateral to the ECS instance, and then from within the ECS instance, copy it
    to the ``sgxdata`` directory within the working directory. Also, copy the latest backup from the KK-Manager instance
    to the KK-Cryptoservice instance as well.

#.  Run KK-Cryptoservice in registration mode on the ECS instance. Make sure that the latest backup is present.

    .. code-block:: console
