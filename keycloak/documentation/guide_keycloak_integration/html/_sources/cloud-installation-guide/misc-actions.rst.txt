Removing KK-Cryptoservice from cloud
------------------------------------

To uninstall KK-Cryptoservice from the ECS instance, follow these steps:

#.  Uninstall the RPM package.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo dnf remove kk-cs-2.0-0000.el8.x86_64.rpm

#.  Clean the firewall rules.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --remove-service=kk-csd.service

#.  It is optional to remove the log files and the working directory, but it is highly recommended.


Stopping instance service
-------------------------

There are `two modes`__ for instances in Alibaba Cloud's virtual private cloud.

*   **Standard Mode**: The resources of the instance are retained and continue to be billed even after
    the instance is stopped.

*   **Economical Mode**: After the instance is stopped, its computing resources (vCPUs and memory)
    are released and no longer billed. The cloud disks (including the system disk and data disks),
    elastic IP addresses (if any), and bandwidth continue to be billed. The public IP address is recycled,
    and the private IP address is retained. For more details, check `Alibaba Cloud's page`__ on economical mode.

Since Kripta Key is bound to the machine, the instance mode must be set to standard mode. Otherwise,
data loss may occur if the instance is stopped, even if onlyy temporarily.

To stop the instance:

*   To stop a single instance, find the instance, and then select More |rarr| Instance Status |rarr| Stop
    in the Actions column. 
*   To stop multiple instances at once, select the instances, and then click Stop in the lower part of the 
    Instances page.
