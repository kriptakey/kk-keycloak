Red Hat Enterprise Linux
------------------------

If the smartcard reader driver has not been installed, install that before starting CLIKK's installer.

#.  Download the smartcard reader driver (``acsccid-linux-bin-1.1.10-20230804.zip``) from `ACS's website`__.

    __ https://www.acs.com.hk/download-driver-unified/13546/acsccid-linux-bin-1.1.10-20230804.zip

#.  Extract the package.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ unzip acsccid-linux-bin-1.1.10-20230804.zip

#.  Navigate to the ``acsccid-linux-bin-1.1.10-20230804.zip/epel/9`` directory and install the RPM.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ cd acsccid-linux-bin-1.1.10-20230804.zip/epel/9
        $ sudo dnf install pcsc-lite-acsccid-1.1.10-1.el9.x86_64.rpm

#.  Enable the pcsc-lite service.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo systemctl enable pcscd.service --now

#.  Make sure that the pcsc-lite service is running by examining the output of the following command.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo systemctl status pcscd.service

After confirming that the pcsc-lite service is running, CLIKK installation may be initiated.

#.  Install CLIKK directly from the RPM.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo dnf install clikk-2.0-0000.el8.x86_64.rpm

#.  Configure CLIKK so it can reach the KK-Manager instance. To do this, the administrator must have
    the host address and port ready.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ clikk conf server --kk-manager-host=<host address> --kk-manager-port=<port>

#.  Close and reopen the terminal to enable CLIKK tab completion.

On Windows, simply execute CLIKK's installer to start the installation process.
