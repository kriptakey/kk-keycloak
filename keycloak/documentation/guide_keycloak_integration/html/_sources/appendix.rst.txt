Common Kripta Key errors
------------------------

When Kripta Key encounters an error, a SNMP message will be emitted and the error will be logged. To investigate
the issue, check the SNMP message or the error log at ``/var/log/kriptakey/``. The following list describes
common errors that may be encountered.

*   **Error message**: ``APP_UNAUTHORIZED``

    **Cause**: KK-Cryptoservice have not replicated the application data.

    **Solution**:

        *   Wait 1 minute for automatic replication to happen.
        *   If after 1 minute this error still occurs, perform manual replication by running
            ``sudo -u kripta kk-csd --replicate-with=/path/to/backup.db``.
        *   Ensure the application certificate is correct.

*   **Error message**: ``APP_IS_LOCKED_ON_PARTITION``

    **Cause**: An application is locked on a particular partition.

    **Solution**: Unlock the app using ``clikk partition unlock-app``.

*   **Error message**: Authentication failed!

    **Cause**: Administrator entered the wrong password.

    **Solution**: If an administrator has forgotten the account's password, reset it using
    ``clikk admin reset-password``. This requires :term:`dual control`.

*   **Error message**: Password reset can only be done by other administrators!

    **Cause**: A regular password reset was attempted when there are only two administrator accounts.

    **Solution**: Reset the administrator's password using ``clikk admin reset-password --with-recovery-cards``

*   **Error message**:
    
    *  Authentication failed!
    *  Recovery card verification failed! Here is a list of corrupted cards:

    **Cause**: A command that requires recovery cards was executed and one of the cards is corrupted.

    **Solution**: Regenerate the recovery cards by running ``clikk kk-manager regenerate-backup-key``.

*   **Error message**: Please wait 30 minutes after account is locked before re-attempting login!

    **Cause**: Too many failed login attempts in a short time.

    **Solution**: Wait 30 minutes, or have another administrator run ``clikk admin unlock``.

*   **Error message**: ``DATABASE_TAMPERED``

    **Cause**: KK-Cryptoservice's database has been tampered or is corrupted.

    **Solution**: Manually replicate the database by running ``sudo -u kripta kk-csd --replicate-with=/path/to/backup.db``.

    **Solution**: If not caused by network issues, check the log in ``/var/log/kriptakey/``, and send it
    to Kripta Key's support team.


Performing integrity checks
---------------------------

.. _Klavis Kripta website: www.klaviskripta.com

Kripta Key installers and related documents are distributed to customers via email from support@klaviskripta.com.
The files are protected using a :term:`PGP` key. The email should also contain the Deployment ID and the Customer ID.

To check their integrity, fetch the digests for this particular version of Kripta Key on the `Klavis Kripta website`_.
Then, compute the SHA-256 hashes of the files:

*   On Windows, execute:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ certutil -hashfile "filename.ext" SHA256

*   On Linux, execute:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sha256sum "filename.ext"

*   Alternatively, if OpenSSL is installed, execute:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ openssl dgst -sha256 "filename.ext"

If a digest mismatch is found, the customer may request the file to be resent, either by sending an email
to support@klaviskripta.com or by calling the designated contact number at www.klaviskripta.com.


Obtaining Intel API key
-----------------------

Since Kripta Key requires Intel® SGX, each machine must contact Intel to ensure that it runs Kripta Key
on trusted environment. Prior to verifying a machine, you need to register to `Intel® Trusted Services
API Management Developer Portal`__ to get the Intel API key. This key authenticates the user in the Intel Server,
allowing multiple machines to use one API key. To get the API key one performs the following steps:

__ https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/provisioning-certification

#.  Go to Intel® Trusted Services API Management Developer Portal to sign up and fill in the required information.

    .. image:: /_static/intel_api_key_1.png

    .. image:: /_static/intel_api_key_2.png

    .. image:: /_static/intel_api_key_3.png

#.  Verify your email by supplying the verification code and clicking create an account.

#.  Upon successful registration, log in to your account, go to Intel SGX and Intel TDX Provisioning Certification
    Service.

    .. image:: /_static/intel_api_key_4.png

#.  Click subscribe on the Get PCK Certificate/s section

    .. image:: /_static/intel_api_key_5.png

#.  Click subscribe to get an API key.

    .. image:: /_static/intel_api_key_6.png

#.  You will get two keys, namely the primary and the secondary. Use either one of them as an API key.
    Click show to use that key.

    .. image:: /_static/intel_api_key_7.png

If you have been registered to Intel® Trusted Services API Management Developer Portal and you already have
an Intel API key, check your Intel API key by performing the following steps:

#.  Go to Intel® Trusted Services API Management Developer Portal, click sign in and fill in your email and password.

    .. image:: /_static/intel_api_key_8.png

#.  Once logged in, go to your profile and click manage subscription.

    .. image:: /_static/intel_api_key_9.png

#.  The list of your Intel API keys is on that page.


Checking for SGX2 support
-------------------------

For systems running Linux, ``cpuid`` outputs information about the processor, including whether
SGX2 is supported or not. Run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cpuid | grep -i sgx

If SGX2 is supported by the processor, the command will output the following:

.. code-block:: console

    SGX supported = True


SNMP configuration
------------------

Setting up a SNMP server for Kripta Key is optional. However, it is strongly recommended to set up and
configure the SNMP server so that critical alerts from Kripta Key can be noticed promptly.

Kripta Key supports Net-SNMP version 5.9.3.

When an error occurs, KK-Manager, KK-Cryptoservice, and KK-Auditor will send an SNMP trap message to a user-defined 
SNMP manager. It also includes crucial system information (CPU, memory, and disk utilization), which is sent every 
minute. The SNMP configuration can be set either during initialization or by running the configuration script.

To configure the SNMP object identifier, upload ``KLAVISKRIPTA-CUSTOM-MIB.txt`` to the SNMP manager.

.. important::

    Ensure that the user registered to the SNMP manager is using SHA ``authProtocol`` and AES ``privProtocol``.
    The following line shows a simple example for SNMP user configuration:

    .. code-block::

        createUser [username] SHA [authPassphrase] AES [privPassphrase] authuser log [username]

.. important::

    Both the authentication password (``authPassphrase``) and the privacy password (``privPassphrase``)
    must be at least 9 characters long.
