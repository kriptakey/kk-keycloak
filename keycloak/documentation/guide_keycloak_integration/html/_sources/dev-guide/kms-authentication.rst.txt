Authentication services
=======================

Each connection from any application to KK-Cryptoservice, via REST API or SDK, is authenticated by
the certificate-based mutual authentication protocol in mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS). A partition ID and
a password constitute additional factors for :term:`login`. A successful login returns a session token, which grants
the application a session to directly access the relevant cryptographic services.

Each session has a one hour time limit. Within one hour, the application may extend its session
by refreshing it using the :term:`refresh session` service. However, a session cannot be extended indefinitely ---
a session will  Additionally, a session may time out and expire
if it is not refreshed within one hour. Once the session expires, the application must obtain a new session
by performing login again in order to access the cryptographic services.

If an application fails to login three times due to incorrect credentials, it will be locked out. This lock out
will normally cease in thirty minutes. However, an administrator may unlock the application immediately
by running the ``clikk partition unlock-app`` command.

    Login
        Applications are allowed access to cryptographic services only if they have a session. Sessions may be
        obtained after a successful login.

    Refresh session
        If an application still needs access to cryptographic services as its session nears the one hour limit,
        the application can call this endpoint to extend the session. The extended session ends in one hour
        from the time of refresh,
