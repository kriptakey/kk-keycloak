WebSocket configuration
=======================

To be able in accessing QRCode during on-boarding and login, a WSS must be configured securely. Therefore, it is necessary 
to configure TLS connection for WSS. Follow the below steps to generate TLS certificate for WSS:

#.  Generate keypair for WSS

    .. code-block:: console

        $ openssl genrsa -out wss.key 4096

#.  Generate WSS CSR and ensure WSS CN is aligned to WSS hostname. If WSS is configured in the same host with Keycloak, then 
    it can use Keycloak hostname

    .. code-block:: console

        $ openssl req -new -key -wss.key -out wss.csr   -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=SanFrancisco/O=MyOrg/OU=MyUnit/CN=wss-hostname.com"

#.  Sign WSS CSR with CA private key and passing the same configuration file ``selfsigned.conf``

    .. code-block:: console

        $ openssl x509 -req -in wss.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial   -out wss.crt -days 825 -extfile selfsigned.conf -extensions v3_ext

#.  After that, go to NGINX Settings, and adjust its configuration especially to set the correct paths of wss certificate and 
    private as followings

    .. code-block:: console

        server {
            listen 8089 ssl;
            listen [::]:8089 ssl;
            server_name localhost;

            # SSL configuration
            ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/wss.crt;
            ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/wss.key;

            # Optional: Strengthen SSL security
            ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
            ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
            ssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH;

            # WebSocket proxy
            location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8090;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            }
        }

#.  Run the following command to connect wss to NGINX

    .. code-block:: console

        $ wscat -c wss://localhost:8081 --no-check

    Ensure that wss is connected.
