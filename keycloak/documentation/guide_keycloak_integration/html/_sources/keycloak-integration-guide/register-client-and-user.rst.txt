Register Client Application and User
====================================

Register Client Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of SSO protocol, client application must be registered to Keycloak before getting access from Keycloak.

#.  To register a client, click on Clients button on the left tab and click on Create client.

    of client that is registered to Keycloak.

#.  Click on Save button.

#.  If you enable Client authentication previously, a client credential is generated. There are several types of credentials. 
    In current configuration, we already tested with Client Id and Secret type. The credential can be used by backend application 
    to create a secure channel to Keycloak.

After the setup process is complete, it's time to activate the user and then try to log in. If it succeeds, it means strong SSO 
authentication has been deployed successfully.
