Import Users to KeyCloak DB 
===========================

In the case of registering many users, instead of creating user one by one, the admin can import the list of users by using 
a custom tool provided by KK. To use that tool, write the users including their data on a .csv file. The tool is developed 
in a bash script. The following steps explain how to use the tool:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./import-users-from-csv.sh --import users.csv

Once you run the above command, you will be prompted to enter some data as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    Base URL (e.g: https://myhostname/auth): http://localhost:8080
    Admin realm: master
    Operational realm: myrealm
    Client ID (create this client in the above Keycloak realm): security-admin-console
    Admin username: admin
    Admin Password: 

To register users to Keycloak, you can utilize admin cli commands. However, you need to provide several data above including 
the admin realm and the intended realm where you want to register users. You can use default admin client id security-admin-console 
but you have to ensure during user registration, Direct access grants is enabled. If it is necessary, you can disable the grant 
access once the data import done.

We provide the tool in our github. You can clone [TODO: put the github link for the repository] and use the tool.
