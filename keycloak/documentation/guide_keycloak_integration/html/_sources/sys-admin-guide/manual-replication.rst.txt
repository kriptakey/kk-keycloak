Manual replication
==================

All objects are stored in the main KK-Manager database, and are regularly replicated to KK-Cryptoservice
and KK-Manager-DR instances for usage and redundancy. This replication is automatically done with a limit
of 25 operations per replication. If automatic replication fails for any reason, then the database must be
manually replicated.


KK-Cryptoservice manual replication
-----------------------------------

#.  Stop the KK-Cryptoservice service.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo systemctl stop kk-csd.service

#.  Copy the most recent backup file from the main KK-Manager machine to the KK-Cryptoservice machine.

#.  Add the backup file to the SELinux policy.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo restorecon <backup file name>

#.  Run the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo -u kripta kk-csd --replicate-from=/var/local/kk/kk-m/backup/20230327-16:20:23.KK-Mbackup

        Commencing the manual replication process.
        This will replicate the KK-Cryptoservice database from /var/local/kk/kk-m/backup/20230327-16:59:37.KK-Mbackup.
        The original database will be copied to /tmp/restore-point-20230327-17:02:01.db.
        Do not interrupt the process until the message "KK-Cryptoservice manual replication has been completed successfully." appears.
        [-] Replicating the database...

        KK-Cryptoservice manual replication has been completed successfully.

#.  Restart the KK-Cryptoservice service.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo systemctl start kk-csd.service


KK-Manager-DR manual replication
--------------------------------

#.  Stop the KK-Manager-DR service.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo systemctl stop kk-md-dr.service

#.  Copy the most recent backup file from the main KK-Manager machine to the KK-Manager-DR machine.

#.  Run the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo -u kripta kk-md --replicate-from=/var/local/kk/kk-m/backup/20230327-16:20:23.KK-Mbackup

        Commencing the manual replication process.
        This will replicate the KK-Manager-DR database from /var/local/kk/kk-m/20230327-16:59:37.KK-Mbackup.
        The original database will be copied to /tmp/restore-point-20230327-16:06:43.db.
        Do not interrupt the process until the message "KK-Manager-DR manual replication has been completed successfully." appears.
        [-] Replicating the database...

        KK-Manager-DR manual replication has been completed successfully.

#.  Restart the KK-Manager-DR service.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo systemctl start kk-md-dr.service
