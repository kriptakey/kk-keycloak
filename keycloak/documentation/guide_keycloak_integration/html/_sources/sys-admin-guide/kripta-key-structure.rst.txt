Kripta Key management overview
==============================

Users
-----

Kripta Key recognizes two types of users, namely, administrators and recovery accounts.

**Administrators**
    This type of user authenticates using a password and an administrator card. Administrators perform most,
    if not all, of the management operations of Kripta Key via CLIKK. This includes object creation, update,
    and deletion. Administrators can also review the KK-Auditor logs of all administrator actions.

**Recovery account**
    This type of user authenticates using recovery cards. Note that this does not refer to each participant
    holding a recovery card --- the collective, capable of authenticating commands with an EMERGENCY
    privilege level, is considered as the recovery account.

.. note::

    *   This document is intended for administrators and recovery card holders.

    *   Users do not perform cryptographic operations. KK-Cryptoservice performs cryptographic operations
        for applications.


Applications
------------

An application that intends to use cryptographic services must first be registered to Kripta Key. Afterwards,
it may use objects in the partitions it is authorized to access for cryptographic operations. Here, objects include
keys, certificats, and secrets.

The cryptographic services may be accessed via REST API or SDK API, if available for the application's
development environment


Command line interface
----------------------

Authentication and privileges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An administrator must use Kripta Key Command Line Interface (CLIKK) to perform management operations
on a KK-Manager instance. Each command has a privilege level, and the authentication attributes required
for each privilege level are detailed as follows:

*   **LOW**: None.
*   **NORMAL**: Administrator password.
*   **HIGH**: Administrator password and administrator card.
*   **CRITICAL**: Dual control --- password and administrator card from two administrators.
*   **EMERGENCY**: Recovery cards. Requires a majority of the recovery card holders to participate.

The administrator password is initialized during account creation. However, administrators created
during key ceremony must change their password so that the system can bind an administrator card
to that administrator. Additional administrators created using ``clikk admin add`` will have a card bound
during the creation process.

Additionally, each partition also has a password that is set during creation. This password is required
for applications accessing the partition. Both the administrator and partition passwords are subject
to these requirements:

*   Password length must be between 8 and 64 characters, inclusive.
*   Password must contain upper case, lower case, numeric, and special characters.
*   Password must not have repeated characters (e.g. AA, aa, 11).
*   Password must not have more than two consecutive characters (e.g. 123, abc).
*   Password must not contain the admin ID.

Kripta Key also implements some restrictions on administrator login:

*   After three consecutive failed attempts, the account will be locked. Locked accounts cannot log in,
    nor perform any administrative actions.
*   A locked account will be automatically unlocked after 30 minutes have elapsed.
*   A locked account may be manually unlocked by another administrator using the ``clikk admin unlock`` command.

The recovery cards are initialized during key ceremony. Two sets of recovery cards are initialized,
and a total number of cards equal to the number of participants are prepared in each set. These cards must be kept
safely and securely, as they are necessary for commands with EMERGENCY privilege level. To execute emergency commands,
a majority of cards from one set must be gathered. To be precise, half of the number of participants
(as specified during key ceremony) plus one, rounded down.


Commands
~~~~~~~~

For explanation on CLIKK commands, see :doc:`/sys-admin-guide/kripta-key-management`.


Attributes
----------

Each object in Kripta Key possesses one or more attributes, detailed in each section.


User
~~~~

**Admin ID**
    The identifier of the administrator. Must be alphanumeric and not more than 20 characters in length.

**Admin name**
    The name of the administrator. It is an additional descriptive label that is shown
    in the output of ``clikk user info``. Must be alphanumeric and not more than 20 characters in length.


Partition
~~~~~~~~~

**Partition ID**
    The identifier of the partition. Must be a number between 1 and 10000, inclusive.

    The date and time when the partition was created.

**Application IDs**
    The list of applications that are registered to this partition.

**KK-Cryptoservices**
    The list of KK-Cryptoservice instances that this partition is registered to.


Key
~~~

**Partition ID**
    The identifier of the partition that is associated with the key.

**Key ID**
    The identifier of the key. Must be alphanumeric and not more than 20 characters in length.

**Key ID (percent-encoded)**
    The identifier of the key, percent-encoded. This is intended for interoperability with PKCS#11 URI format.

**Key label**
    The descriptive label of the key.

**Algorithm**
    The cryptographic algorithm used with the key.

**Key length**
    The length of the key, in bits.

**Creation date**
    The date and time when the key was created.

**Expiry date**
    The date and time when the key will expire. It is based on the key’s lifetime that you specify when creating the key.

**Key purpose**
    The purpose of the key. Certain purposes are only compatible with certain key algorithms.
    Kripta Key regulates the availability of keys based on their purpose. A key that the purpose 
    is encryption, wrapping, signing, or MAC generation can be used to protect more than one data. 
    Meanwhile, certificate signing key is only applicable to signing one piece of data.

**Extractable**
    The extractable state of the key. Extractable keys may be exported out of the system.
    Defaults to unset. Refer to :ref:`sys-admin-guide/kripta-key-structure:updatable key attributes`.

**Revoked**
    The revocation status of the key.

**Rotatable**
    The rotatable state of the key. Rotatable keys may be rotated, generating a new key material
    under the same key ID with a newer version. The default value is NOT ROTATABLE. Refer to :ref:`sys-admin-guide/kripta-key-structure:updatable key attributes`.

**Public key**
    The public key of the key pair, in PEM format. Only applicable to asymmetric keys.

**Key version**
    The version of the key. New key versions are created when the key is rotated. Only applicable to
    AES keys whose key purpose is encryption.

**Key check value**
    The checksum of the key, as defined by PKCS#11.

**Elliptic curve**
    The underlying elliptic curve of the key. Only applicable to ECDSA and EdDSA keys.

**Key lifetime**
    The duration for which the key is valid for cryptographic operations that generate new data.
    When a key expires, it may only be used for these operations:

        * Decryption
        * Unsealing
        * Detokenization
        * Signature verification
        * MAC verification
        * Certificate verification
        * Application-stored counterparts of the above

    AES keys whose key purpose are encryption may be rotated, either manually or automatically, to renew the key
    and make it available for all cryptographic operations. Since key rotation is not available for all other keys,
    ensure that if set, the key lifetime is set to the correct value.

**Extension file**
    A JSON file that serves as an extension of either a CSR or a
    certificate.

Updatable Key Attributes
------------------------

**Extractable**
    Using command ``clikk key update``, you can change the extractable state 
    based on the extractable_code below:

    +-----------------------------+------------------+
    | Extractable State           | extractable code |
    +=============================+==================+
    | NO (disable to be exported) | 0                |
    +-----------------------------+------------------+
    | YES (enable to be exported) | 1                |
    +-----------------------------+------------------+

    Once this attribute is set to NO, it can’t be set to YES

**Rotatable**
    The rotatable 
    flag is optional in command ``clikk key update`` and applicable only for AES key with purpose encryption. 
    Using command ``clikk key update``, you can set the rotatable state based on the rotatable_code below:

    +---------------------------+----------------+
    | Rotatable State           | rotatable code |
    +===========================+================+
    | Manually Rotatable        | 0              |
    +---------------------------+----------------+
    | Automatically Rotatable   | 1              |
    +---------------------------+----------------+

    Manually rotatable means the key will be rotated manually using command ``clikk key rotate``. While automatically 
    otatable means the key will be rotated automatically by the system based on the key’s lifetime. The version of 
    AES encryption key that is rotated manually or automatically will increase 1 version in every rotation. The first 
    version before rotation is 0 (zero).
